      " This insurance policy is a legal contract between the policy-owner (you) and the company (we or us). It insures you and your auto for the period shown on the Coverage Selections Page. As long as you pay your premium, we agree to provide you or others the benefits to which you or they are entitled. The exact terms and conditions are explained in the following pages. There are two basic categories of insurance described in this policy, Compulsory Insurance and Optional Insurance. Compulsory There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance. They are all re- Insurance quired by law. Every auto registered in Massachusetts must have them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Optional There are eight Parts to Optional Insurance. Some of them extend Insurance the coverage or the amounts of protection provided by Compulsory Insurance. Some of them provide protection not found in Compulsory Insurance. You do not have to buy any of these eight Parts if you do not want to. Auto insurance claims arise in hundreds of different ways. Autos are sometimes stolen or damaged. Accidents may injure people in your auto, people in other autos or pedestrians. You may be responsible for an accident or someone else may be. An accident may happen in Massachusetts or out of state.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Different situations require different kinds of insurance. Please read the whole policy to see what kinds of insurance are available to cover these different situations. At the same time, you should check the Coverage Selections Page to make sure it correctly indicates the coverages you purchased. Each coverage you purchased will show a premium charge next to it. If no premium charge is shown, you do not have that coverage. Sometimes you and we will agree to change this policy. The only way that can be done is by an “Endorsement” added to the basic policy form. All endorsements must be in writing.\n",

If you have an accident or loss, or if someone sues you, contact your agent or us. Do the same if you have any questions or complaints. If you think we have treated you unfairly at any time, you may contact the Division of Insurance, (617) 521-7777.\n",

      " Our Agreement This policy is a legal contract under Massachusetts law. Because this is an auto policy, it only covers accidents and losses which result from the ownership, maintenance or use of autos. The exact protection is determined by the coverages you purchased. We agree to provide the insurance protection you purchased for accidents which happen while this policy is in force. You agree to pay premiums when due and to cooperate with us in case of accidents or claims. Our contract consists of this policy, the Coverage Selections Page, any endorsements agreed upon, and your application for insurance.

No law requires you to buy more than this Compulsory Insurance. However, if you have financed your auto, the bank or finance company may legally insist that you have some Optional Insurance as a condition of your loan. The amount of your coverage and the cost of each Part is shown on the Coverage Selections Page. Your Compulsory Insurance does not pay for any damage to your auto no matter what happens to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Part 1. Under this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed by Bodily Injury your auto in Massachusetts accidents. The damages we will pay To Others are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement. We will pay only if you or someone else using your auto with your consent is legally responsible for the accident. The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is $20,000. Subject to this $20,000 limit, the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident is $40,000.\n",

For injuries to guest occupants of your auto. 2. For accidents outside of Massachusetts or in places in Massa- chusetts where the public has no right of access. 3. For injuries to any employees of the legally responsible person if they are entitled to Massachusetts workers’ compensation benefits. The law provides a special protection for anyone entitled to damages under this Part. We must pay their claims even if false statements were made when applying for this policy or your auto registration.\n",

We will pay the benefits described below to you and other people injured or killed in auto accidents. For any one accident, we will pay as many people as are injured, but the most we will pay for injuries to any one person is $8,000. This is the most we will pay no matter how many autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. We will pay three kinds of benefits: A.\n",

Lost Wages If an injured person is out of work because of the accident, we will pay lost wages up to 75% of his or her average weekly gross wage or equivalent for the year ending on the day immediately before the accident. We will not pay for the loss of any other type of income. If the injured person was unemployed at the time of the accident, we will pay up to 75% of the amount he or she actually lost in earning power as a result of the accident.\n",

We will pay PIP benefits to or for: 1. You, or any other person, if injured while occupying your auto with your consent. 2. You, or anyone living in your household, if injured while occupying an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory Insurance or if struck by an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory Insurance 3.\n",

Benefits are paid only for expenses or losses actually incurred within two years after the accident. If the accident is in Massachusetts, or if it is outside Massachusetts and the injured person does not sue for damages, we will pay benefits within a reasonable time – usually thirty days. If the accident is outside Massachusetts and the injured person does sue, then we can wait for a settlement or judgment before paying benefits. Some people have a wage continuation program at work. If so, we will pay them only the difference between the total we would ordi- narily pay under this Part and the amount of the program payments.\n",

      " We will, however, reimburse the program if it allows benefits to be converted into cash or additional retirement credit. Sometimes program benefits are reduced or used up because of payments to the person injured in an accident. In that case, we will pay for lost wages resulting from any other illness or injury that person has within one year of our last payment. The exact amount of our payments under this paragraph will be determined by Massachusetts law. Some people have a policy of health, sickness, or disability insur- ance or a contract or agreement with a group, organization part- nership or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical expenses (“health plan”).\n",

We will also pay medical expenses in excess of $2,000 for such injured person which will not be paid by a health plan. Medical expenses must be submitted to the health plan to determine what the health plan will pay before we pay benefits in excess of $2,000 under this Part. We will not pay for medical expenses in excess of $2,000 that the health plan would have paid had the injured person sought treatment in accordance with the requirements of the health plan. In any case, our total payment for medical expenses, lost wages and replacement services will not exceed $8,000.\n",

Anyone who, at the time of the accident, was operating or occupying a motorcycle, any motor vehicle not subject to motor vehicle registration, or a motorized bicycle, including a moped. 2. Anyone who contributed to his or her injury by operating an auto (a) while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or a narcotic drug, (b) while committing a felony or seeking to avoid arrest by a police officer, or (c) with the specific intent of causing injury to himself, herself or others. 3.

      " When you purchased this Part you were given the choice of either excluding yourself, or yourself and household members, from some or all of the PIP coverage. The portion of each claim you may have agreed not to be covered for is called a “deductible.” You paid a smaller premium if you chose a deductible. In that case, we will only pay up to the difference between $8,000 and the amount of your deductible. The deductible is shown on the Coverage Selections Page. If anyone is entitled to PIP benefits and also to benefits under another Part of this policy, we will pay from this Part first.\n",

If anyone covered under this policy is also entitled to PIP benefits from any other auto policy, the total benefits payable will not be more than the highest amount payable under whichever one of the policies would have paid the most. In that case, each insurer will pay only its proportionate share. We will not pay benefits under this Part which duplicate payments made under the No-Fault coverage of any other auto policy.\n",

Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily Uninsured Auto injury to people injured or killed in certain accidents caused by uninsured or hit-and-run autos.

However, Massachusetts law provides that we may refuse to sell Collision (Part 7) and Comprehensive (Part 9), or both, in certain specified instances. Because two of the Optional coverages – Collision (Part 7) and Limited Collision (Part 8) – duplicate each other in many ways, you may buy one of them but not both.\n",
