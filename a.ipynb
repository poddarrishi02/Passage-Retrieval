      " These types of automobiles are described more fully in Section 2. Certificate of Automobile Insurance A Certificate of Automobile Insurance is a written document summarizing your insurance coverage. It shows your name and/or organization, and the described automobile or automobiles. It lists the coverages purchased, premiums charged, and the period during which the insurance is in effect. Covered/Coverage When we talk of someone or something being covered, we mean that they are protected by insurance. When we speak of coverage, we are describing what types of protection they have and how much for each type. Direct Loss or Damage Direct loss or damage refers to damage or loss caused directly by a peril.\n",

Excluded Driver An excluded driver is someone specifically not covered by this policy when driving the described, temporary substitute or newly acquired automobile(s). The only exception is coverage for those Accident Benefits the law requires to be paid to anyone injured in an automobile accident in Ontario.

Spouse Spouse means either of two persons who: • are married to each other; • have together entered into a marriage that is voidable or void, in good faith on the part of the person making a claim under this policy; or • have lived together in a conjugal relationship outside marriage, o continuously for a period of not less than three years, or o in a relationship of some permanence, if they are the natural or adoptive parents of a child.\n",

      "\n",
      " There may be a minimum premium shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This will not be refunded.
